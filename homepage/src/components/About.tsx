    <p>
      Hello. I'm Hannah, and this is my page. I am actually not a cat, that's
      just a placeholder picture for now. Sorry to disappoint you.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I am a software developer with many different interests. You will
      find on this page links to various web apps that I create, I hope you find
      them useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't have any way for you to chip in on the upkeep of this page yet,
      but one day I will add something so that you can. In the meantime, please
      enjoy the apps.
